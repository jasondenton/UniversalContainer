This is the UniversalContainer library, by Jason Denton.

For full documentation, see the /doc directory and start with
libuc.html

This library provides the UniversalContainer class, which is a C++ 
lass that attempts to mimic the general purpose dictionaries of many
popular scripting languages, such as Perl, Python and PHP.

Included is an in memory REST parser and serializer. This allows for
data to be manipulated in place and written at once, or read all at
once and then dealth with from the in memory structure, rather than having
to build or parse the stream one token at a time as other C++ JSON libraries
require. Additional facilities allow for checking dictionaries, such as those
representing REST data, against schema. These schema can be expressed 
in a way that is less awful than the standard JSON Schema, and the
checked with more percision.

Additional routines for interfacing with MySQL, SQLite, and CURL
leverage the expressive power of the UniversalContainer to make working
with those libraries easier.

This library is covered by the new BSD license, see the LICENSE file for
details To build the library,  double check options at the start of the
make file then run make. The file doc/index.html is the starting point
for the documentation.
