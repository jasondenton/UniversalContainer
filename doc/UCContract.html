<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The static methods within the UCSchema class provides a means to evaluate a
  given UniversalContainer and determine if it meets a pre-defined set of criteria. 
  These criteria specify the type of the data held by the container, and the possible
  values it may take on. Two key ideas are helpful in understanding these functions.
  The first is the notion of a contract, which defines the constraints which a particular
  UniversalContainer must satisfy. The second is the notion of a schema, which is a contract
  which has been bound to an identifying name and stored within the global library. To use
  the UCSchema functions, you define a set of schema using a simple language, and then
  add them to this global library. You may then check UniversalContainers against these
  schema by name.</p>

<h2>An Example Schema</h2>

<h2>Describing a Contract</h2>
<p>A schema is described in as a block of formated plain text, which is then sent to one of the
<tt>add_contract_to_library</tt> methods to add the schema described to the global library. 
A schema always has the form:

<span class="code">
  schemaname ==> contract
</span>

where <tt>schemaname</tt> is an identifier and contract is a valid contract as described below. Valid identifiers are formed by an alphabetic character followed by one or more alpha-numeric characters.
Contracts are a combination of type information and constraints that must be meet by an object, and
can specify scalars, dictionaries, or arrays as described below. Contracts may describe scalar data,
map objects, or arrays of objects. They may also describe a group of possible contracts, satisfying
any one of which will cause the contract to be satisfied. Additional, each contract may have an
optional tag, identifying data which must match a provided symbol table.</p>

<h3>Scalar Contracts</h3>
<p>A scalar contract describes a contract on a scalar data type or a string. 
  These contracts consist of a keyword that declares the type, and an optional
  restriction on the possible values that the data may take on specified in 
  parentheses.</p>

<p><table class="dictionary">
  <tr>
    <th>Contract</th><th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>integer(MIN:MAX)</tt></td>
    <td>The <tt>integer</tt> keyword specifies that the data under consideration
      must be of type Integer. If parentheses are present, then one or both of
      MIN and MAX must be specified. If only one value is specified it is interpreted
      as the minimum value for the data, unless it is preceded by a colon (:),
      in which case it is interpreted as a maximum value for the data.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>real(MIN:MAX)</tt></td>
    <td>The <tt>real</tt> keyword specifies that the data under consideration
      must be of type Real. If parentheses are present,
      then one or both of MIN and MAX must be specified. If only one value is specified it
      is interpreted as the minimum value for the data, unless it is preceded by a
      colon (:), in which case it is interpreted as a maximum value for the data.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>character(MIN:MAX)</tt></td>
    <td>The <tt>character</tt> keyword specifies that the data under consideration
      must be of type Integer. If parentheses are present, then one or both of
      MIN and MAX must be specified. If only one value is specified it is interpreted
      as the minimum value for the data, unless it is preceded by a colon (:),
      in which case it is interpreted as a maximum value for the data. For a character,
      valid minimum and maximum values are un-escaped characters.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>boolean(true | false)</tt></td>
    <td>The <tt>boolean</tt> keyword specifies that the data under consideration must be of
      type boolean. If parentheses are present, then the literal "true" or "false" must also
      appear to constrain the value to one of those two values. This feature is intended to be
      used with group contracts (explained below), which allow for a schema to be satisfied if a particular data item conforms to one of several different sub-schema.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>string(regex)</tt></td>
    <td>The <tt>string</tt> keyword specifies that the data under consideration
      must be of a string. If parentheses are present, then they must contain a regular
      expression which the string must match in order to satisfy the contract. The
      underlying regex checking is done using the system regex routines described in regex.h,
      see <tt>man regex</tt> and <tt>re_format</tt> for a description of the dialect.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table></p>

<h3>Map Contracts</h3>

<p>A map schema specifies constrains on a map. Fields where the key value is separated from the contract by a colon are required and must appear in
order for the contract to be satisfied. Fields where the key value is separated by the contract by
a question mark are optional. They do not have to appear, but if they do they must satisfy the
contract. The order in which fields appear does not matter. Key values are double quoted strings.

A map schema takes the form :

<span class="code">
{
  "required_key" : contract,
  "optional_key" ? contact
  ...
}
</span>

<h3>Array Contracts</h3>

<p>Array contracts allow for a variety of constraints to be placed on an array and its contents,
  expressed as a series of sub-contracts. The <tt>#type</tt> contract specifies a contract
  that all elements must satisfy. The <tt>#exists</tt> contract specifies a contract that must be
  satisified by at least one element of the array. The <tt>#size</tt> contract must be an integer contract,
  and it applied to the number of elements in the array, rather than the contents. It also possible
  to place constraints on particular elements of an array. Instead of one of the preceding keywords,
  a contract may be associated with an integer. The contract is then applied to that 
  zero-indexed position in the array.</p>

An array contract takes the form 

<span class="code">
[
#type: contract,
#size: integer contract,
#exists: contract
integer : contract
]
</span>


<h3>Object Schema</h3>


<td><tt>type</tt></td>
<td>The <tt>type</tt> keyword specifies a contract which all members of the array must satisfy.

<td><tt>size</tt></td>
<td>The <tt>size</tt> keyword specifies an integer contract which the size of the array must satisfy.

<td><tt>exists</tt></td>
<td>The <tt>exists</tt> keyword specifies a contract which must be satisfied by one or more elements of
  the array.

<td><tt>position</tt></td>
<td>A position element takes the form of an integer, which specifies that the element that occurs at that
  zero-indexed position must match the given contract.



Group Contracts

Group contracts take the form :

#group
  contract contract ...
#endgroup 


A group contract is satisfied if any of the component contracts is satisfied.

Tagged Contracts

Any valid contract may be tagged, by prefixing it with a name enclosed in angle brackets. If the name of the tag is not found in the symbol table, the value of the satisfying object is cloned into a symbol table.
If the given name is found in the symbol table, the contract is instead checked for
equality with UniversalContainer which previously satisfied that tag. By using the versions of the compare and compare_and_throw that allow for a symbol table to passed in, it is possible to prel-oad the symbol table with the desired values, or to preserve the values across multiple calls to the compare routines.

  is no indication of which element caused a particular flag to be

    <p>These functions operate similar to the corresponding compare functions, but instead of
      returning a value they will throw an exception. This exception will be a map type, with
      two keys. The key <tt>compare_results</tt> contains the value that would have been returned 
      by compare. The key <tt>violations</tt> contains an array of strings explaining the various
      errors.</p>

      <p>The conditions field is ORed with the results of the compare. If the results are non-zero
        the exception is thrown. This can be used to allow some conditions, such as the presence
        of extra map elements, to not throw an exception.</p>

<p>UCSchema allows for the definition of user types. If the provided type
type parameter is not one of the values listed above, UCSchema consults a
hidden, library of named UCContact objects for a match. If a match is
found the contract object will reference that contrat when doing compare
operations. The library is initially empty, but types can be added to 
the library with the static method add_to_library. Note that the reference
to the type library is established when the contract is constructed,
not during the comparision.  If you have a contract that references another
contract by name you must add the named contract to the library before you do
the comparison. Circular references are not possible.</p>

<p>When a contract is created any required regex is compiled and saved
for later use. Otherwise, creating a new instance of UCSchema is not
terribly expensive. However, in most cases it will involve
deserializing the UniversalContainer describing the contract; most
likely from some JSON source. This can be expensive, especially if it
involves an I/O operation.</p>

<p>Recommended usage of UCSchema is to do all loading of contracts that will
  be needed during a programs lifetime at once, adding each one to global
  contract library with add_to_library. Then, during program operation,
  use the provided static methods to check objects against contracts by
  their named types.</p>

<p>UCSchema conforms to the UniversalContainer metadata contract, and
  ignores any field in a map which begins with a hash mark (#).</p>


<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Below is an example of a contract description in JSON, showing how
to use the various elements. To use a contract like this, you would
first deserialize the JSON to a UniversalContainer using
uc_decode_json, and then pass the resulting UC to the constructor for
a UCSchema object.</p>

  more violations of the contract; depending on which bits of the
  return code are set. Note that in the case of arrays and maps, there
  is no indication of which element caused a particular flag to be
  set, and there may be multiple violations of the same type. The following

<h3 class="method">static void compare_and_throw(std::string const&amp; name, UniversalContainer&amp;, unsigned = 0XFFFFFFFF) const</h3>
  <p>This method calls compare on the given container, and performs an

  uce_ContractViolation, and the key compare_result set to the value
  of the compare operation ored with the mask. The key violations
  maps to an array of strings containing the same messages produced by
  the error_messages method.</p>

  <p>The static version compares a container against a named type previously

 <p>This static method adds the contract defined by the container contract to the global
  type library. It causes a new contract to be created, but this contract is stored in
  the library rather than being returned to the user. Calling this method with the a name
  previously added to the library will replace previous entry in the library and delete the
  previous contract. This will break any currently existing contracts that reference the old
  entry; and seg faults are likely to follow.
