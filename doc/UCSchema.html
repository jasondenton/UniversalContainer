<h1>class UCSchema</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The static methods within the UCSchema class provides a means to evaluate a
  given UniversalContainer and determine if it meets a pre-defined set of criteria. 
  These criteria specify the type of the data held by the container and the possible
  values it may take on. Two key ideas are helpful in understanding these functions.
  The first is the notion of a contract, which defines the constraints which a particular
  UniversalContainer must satisfy. The second is the notion of a schema, which is a contract
  which has been bound to an identifying name and stored within the global library. To use
  the UCSchema functions, you define a set of schema using a simple language, and then
  add them to this global library. You may then check UniversalContainers against these
  schema by name.</p>

<h2>An Example Schema</h2>
<pre><div class="code_example">car ==> {
   "model" : string
   "plate" : string("\w\w\w\d\d\d\d")
   "year" : integer(1900:)
   "milage" : real(0.0:250000.0)
   "used" : boolean
   "smogcode" : character
}

boat ==> {
   "length" : real(5.0:),
   "displacement" : real,
   "plate" : string("WV \d\d\d\d\d")
}

owner ==> {
   "name" : string("[A-Z][a-z]* [A-Z][a-z]*")
   "age" : integer(16:75)
}

dmvrecord ==> {
   "vehicle" : #group
      car
      boat
   #endgroup
   "owners" : [
      #type : owner
      #size : integer(1:)
   ]
}
</div></pre>

<h2>Describing a Schema</h2>
<p>A schema is described in a block of formated plain text, which is then sent to one of the
<tt>add_contract_to_library</tt> methods to add the schema described to the global library. 
A schema always has the form:

<pre><div class="code_example">schemaname ==> contract</div></pre>

where <tt>schemaname</tt> is an identifier and contract is a valid contract. Valid identifiers
are formed by an alphabetic character followed by one or more alpha-numeric characters.
Contracts are a combination of type information and constraints that must be meet by a 
UniversalContainer. A contract can specify scalars, dictionaries, or arrays. Contracts may 
also describe a group of possible contracts, satisfying any one of which will cause the contract
to be satisfied. Additional, each contract may have an optional tag, identifying data which 
must match a provided symbol table.</p>

<h3>Schema Contracts</h3>
  <p>When a valid schema identifier appears in place of a contract, it is interpreted as the
  contract to mean the contract associated with the schema at the time when the contract is checked.
  This allows schemas to be referenced from within other schemas or contracts. When the contract parser
  encounters such an identifier it is not checked, instead a contract is created with a reference to the
  identifier. Only when that contract is later checked against a UniversalContainer is the global library
  checked for a matching contract. Consequently, schema names do not have to a be forward declared.</p>

<h3>Scalar Contracts</h3>
<p>A scalar contract describes a contract on a scalar data type or a string. 
  These contracts consist of a keyword that declares the type, and an optional
  restriction on the possible values that the data may take on specified in 
  parentheses.</p>

<p><table class="dictionary">
  <tr>
    <th>Contract</th><th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>integer(MIN:MAX)</tt></td>
    <td>The <tt>integer</tt> keyword specifies that the data under consideration
      must be of type Integer. If parentheses are present, then one or both of
      MIN and MAX must be specified. If only one value is specified it is interpreted
      as the minimum value for the data, unless it is preceded by a colon (:),
      in which case it is interpreted as a maximum value for the data.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>real(MIN:MAX)</tt></td>
    <td>The <tt>real</tt> keyword specifies that the data under consideration
      must be of type Real. If parentheses are present,
      then one or both of MIN and MAX must be specified. If only one value is specified it
      is interpreted as the minimum value for the data, unless it is preceded by a
      colon (:), in which case it is interpreted as a maximum value for the data.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>character(MIN:MAX)</tt></td>
    <td>The <tt>character</tt> keyword specifies that the data under consideration
      must be of type Integer. If parentheses are present, then one or both of
      MIN and MAX must be specified. If only one value is specified it is interpreted
      as the minimum value for the data, unless it is preceded by a colon (:),
      in which case it is interpreted as a maximum value for the data. For a character,
      valid minimum and maximum values are un-escaped characters.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>boolean(true | false)</tt></td>
    <td>The <tt>boolean</tt> keyword specifies that the data under consideration must be of
      type boolean. If parentheses are present, then the literal "true" or "false" must also
      appear to constrain the value to one of those two values. This feature is intended to be
      used with group contracts (explained below), which allow for a schema to be satisfied if a particular data item conforms to one of several different sub-schema.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>string(regex)</tt></td>
    <td>The <tt>string</tt> keyword specifies that the data under consideration
      must be of a string. If parentheses are present, then they must contain a regular
      expression which the string must match in order to satisfy the contract. The
      underlying regex checking is done using the system regex routines described in regex.h,
      see <tt>man regex</tt> and <tt>re_format</tt> for a description of the dialect.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table></p>

<h3>Map Contracts</h3>

<p>A map schema contract specifies constraints on a map. Fields where the key value is separated
  from the contract by a colon are required and must appear in order for the contract to be
  satisfied. Fields where the key value is separated by the contract by a question mark are optional. 
  They do not have to appear, but if they do they must satisfy the contract. The order in which
  fields appear does not matter. Key values are double quoted strings.

A map schema takes the form :

<pre><div class="code_example">{
  "required_key" : contract,
  "optional_key" ? contact
  ...
}
</div></pre>

<h3>Array Contracts</h3>

<p>Array contracts allow for a variety of constraints to be placed on an array and its contents,
  expressed as a series of sub-contracts. The <tt>#type</tt> contract specifies a contract
  that all elements must satisfy. The <tt>#exists</tt> contract specifies a contract that must be
  satisfied by at least one element of the array. The <tt>#size</tt> contract must be an integer contract,
  and it is applied to the number of elements in the array, rather than the contents. It also possible
  to place constraints on particular elements of an array. Instead of one of the preceding keywords,
  a contract may be associated with an integer. The contract is then applied to that 
  zero-indexed position in the array.</p>

<p>An array contract takes the form :

<pre><div class="code_example">[
   #type: contract,
   #size: integer contract,
   #exists: contract
   integer : contract
]
</div></pre>
</p>


<h3>Group Contracts</h3>

<p>Group contracts provide a mechanism for dealing with UniversalContainers that 
  might be satisfied by one of several possible sub-contracts. It can be used 
  to specify a constrained set of types that will satisfy the constraints. Alternatively,
  if there are interdependencies between data values in a satisfying object, group contracts
  can be used to specify the possible variations.</p>

Group contracts take the form :

<pre><div class="code_example">#group
   contract 
   contract 
   ...
#endgroup 
</div></pre>


<h3>Tagged Contracts</h3>

<p>Any valid contract may be tagged, by prefixing it with a name enclosed in angle brackets. 
  If the name of the tag is not found in the symbol table, the value of the satisfying object
  is cloned into a symbol table. If the given name is found in the symbol table, the contract
  is instead checked for equality with UniversalContainer which previously satisfied that tag.
  By using the versions of the compare and compare_and_throw that allow for a symbol table to
  passed in, it is possible to preload the symbol table with the desired values, or to preserve
  the values across multiple calls to the compare routines. When using the compare routines
  without a symbol table an internal symbol table is still maintained, filled, and checked
  for the duration of the call.</p>


<h2>UCSchema Static Methods</h2>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">static void UCSchema::add_contract_to_library(Buffer* buf)</h3>
<h3 class="method">static void UCSchema::add_contract_to_library(char* str)</h3>
<p>These functions take a block of plain text that describes one or more schema and parses it,
adding the results to the global library.</p>
</div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">static unsigned compare(std::string const&amp; contract, const UniversalContainer&amp; uc)</h3>
<h3 class="method">static unsigned compare(std::string const&amp; contract, const UniversalContainer&amp; uc, UniversalContainer&amp; symbol_table)</h3>
  <p>Compares the container uc against the named contract, and returns 0 if
  uc matches the contract. A non-zero return value indicates one or
  more violations of the contract; depending on which bits of the
  return code are set. Note that in the case of arrays and maps, there
  is no indication of which element caused a particular flag to be
  set, and there may be multiple violations of the same type. The following
  table details the various masks which can be ANDed with the return code
  to determine which errors occurred.</p>

  <p>If <tt>symbol_table</tt> is provided, it must be a map or null. If any values of the map are
    set any tagged contracts within the schema are checked against those values. Other tagged values
    are inserted into the symbol_table, which is turned into a map if it comes in as null.</p>

  <p><table class="dictionary">
    <tr>
      <td>ucc_NO_SUCH_TYPE</td>
      <td>No type with the name given by <tt>contract</tt> has been registered with the library.
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ucc_IMPROPER_TYPE</td>
      <td>The container or one or more of its elements has the wrong data type.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ucc_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION</td>
      <td>The value of the container violates the constraints specified in the contract. 
        This is also the flag that signals an array that has violated its size 
        constraints, or for which some element has violated that exists constraint.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ucc_EXTRA_MAP_ELEMENT</td>
      <td>A map contains one or more elements that are not specified in as required or optional.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ucc_MISSING_REQUIRED_MAP_ELEMENT</td>
      <td>A map is missing an element that is marked as required.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ucc_MISSING_REQUIRED_ARRAY_ELEMENT</td>
      <td>An array does not contain an element that is specified in
    the exists constraint.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ucc_STRING_DOES_NOT_MATCH</td>
      <td>Some string does not match the given regex expression.</td>
    </tr>
  </table></p>
</div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">static void compare_and_throw(std::string const&amp; contract, 
                                                 const UniversalContainer&amp; uc, 
                                                 unsigned conditions = 0XFFFFFFFF)</h3>
<h3 class="method">static void compare_and_throw(std::string const&amp; contract, 
                            const UniversalContainer&amp; uc, 
                            UniversalContainer&amp; symbol_table, 
                            unsigned conditions = 0XFFFFFFFF)</h3>

    <p>These functions operate similar to the corresponding compare functions, but instead of
      returning a value they will throw an exception. This exception will be a UniversalContainer with a map type, similar to other exceptions thrown by the library. Two additional keys will be present.
      The key <tt>compare_results</tt> contains the value that would have been returned 
      by compare. The key <tt>violations</tt> contains an array of strings explaining the various
      errors.</p>

      <p>The conditions field is ORed with the results of the compare. If the results are non-zero
        the exception is thrown. This can be used to allow some conditions, such as the presence
        of extra map elements, to not throw an exception.</p>
</div>

<h2>Public, non-static methods of UCContract</h2>
<p>UCContract contains a number of public, non-static methods. These methods are not documented 
  or supported, but are unlikely to undergo much further evolution. If a new way to specify 
  schema is required, such as with JSONSchema, these methods would be a good place to start.</p>
