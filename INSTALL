Configuration of UniversalContainer is handled with a few lines
at the top of the makefile. These control building CURL, MYSQL,
and SQLite support, all of which require the appropriate libraries
be installed and available at compile time. You can also set the
install location there. Then just 

make; sudo make install

UniversalContainer depends on both Flex and Bison for its JSON parsing
and contract checking capabilities. Unforatuntely, the versions that
come with MacOS are quite dated, and are insufficent for building
UniversalContainer.

Flex in particular has a long dependency chain, and so it is recommened
that if you need to install it on a mac you use homebrew. You can set
the needed binary locations at the top of the provided Makefile.

UniversalContainer was last test with Flex 2.6.4 and Bison 3.4.1.
